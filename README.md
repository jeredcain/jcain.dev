### Greetings!
If you haven't already, now it's time to log in to your GitHub account and set up your GitHub Pages site following the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/). To get a head start you can simply use the generator with one of the provided themes and **add some reasonable content to your new page**.

### Thanks
... to **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)** for their superb DNS service that makes this possible. While JS.ORG is using their free plan - to a shameless extent - they helped us more than once with some flexible solutions and extended quotas. Many thanks!
