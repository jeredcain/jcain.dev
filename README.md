**The online home of Jered Cain, frontend/fullstack web developer based in Perú**

### Greetings!
I'm Jered Cain, a web-focused software developer based in wonderful [perú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru). I specialise in **HTML5** + **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6/7)** + **jQuery**, and **Python + Django**, on desktop and mobile platforms.

### Values
I'm a strong proponent of automation and reducing or optimising repetitive patterns, helping to save both time and money. I take a broad-view approach, and won't try to give you something you don't need, but might suggest something you hadn't thought of.

### Contact
If you're interested in talking to me about the work I do, please **[drop me a line](mailto:hello@jcain.dev?subject=Enquiry via website)** and we can start a conversation.
